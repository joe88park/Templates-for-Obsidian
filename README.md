# Templates-for-Obsidian

These are some of the templates I use for Obsidian

Description
I added this to my Github page becasue I can believe that having templates in obsidian make a huge productivity difference.
These are a few of my light-weight templates I use, so if you're new and don't have a beginner set of templates, feel free to use mine
as a jump start. 

... I'm figuring out how to use Github ... bare with me for the updates
 
Added the template files for my Book Notes and Daily Notes.
